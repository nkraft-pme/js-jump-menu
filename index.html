      <h2 id="ar" data-menutitle="AR Speakers">Acoustic Research (AR)</h2>
      <p>Acoustic Research was a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company that manufactured high-end audio equipment. The brand is now owned by VOXX. Acoustic Research was known for the AR-3 series of speaker systems, which used the 12 in (300 mm) acoustic suspension woofer of the AR-1 with newly designed dome mid-range speaker and high-frequency drivers. AR's line of acoustic suspension speakers were the first loudspeakers with relatively flat response, extended bass, wide dispersion, small size, and reasonable cost. The AR Turntable remains a highly sought vinyl record player. </p>

      <h2 id="advent" data-menutitle="Advent Speakers">Advent</h2>
      <p>Around 1968, Henry Kloss quit <a href="#klh">KLH</a> to develop a low-cost projection television, but had trouble financing the leading-edge research and development that was still required. To earn some money, he decided to build a high-performance low-cost dual driver speaker system with 10-inch (25 cm) woofer called simply The Advent Loudspeaker (later given the retronym the Larger Advent, after introduction of The Smaller Advent Loudspeaker). It rivaled the sound of the then top-line AR Model 3a (which used three drivers and a 12-inch (30 cm) woofer), but only cost about half as much.</p>

      <p>Advent produced a number of different versions of the 2-way Advent, including the Advent Loudspeaker, the Smaller Advent Loudspeaker, the "New" Advent Loudspeaker, Advent/2, Advent/3, 4000 series, and 5000 series, to name a few. They were usually offered in both wood veneer and vinyl-covered "utility" cabinet versions, which other than appearance were acoustically identical. </p>

      <h2 id="boston" data-menutitle="BA Speakers">Boston Acoustics</h2>
      <p>Boston Acoustics was an American manufacturer of home and mobile audio equipment founded in 1979. The company produced speakers for home, custom/architectural, and car audio. </p>
      <p>Advent veterans Andy Kotsatos (known as Andy Petite) and Frank Reed founded the company in 1979. Andy Kotsatos was known as Andy Petite. His grandfather immigrated to the United States and worked as a waiter in a French restaurant. Because of his small stature, the rest of the staff named him Le Petit: French for small. Eventually bending to the social pressure to Americanize, he changed his name from Kostatsos to Petite. After founding Boston Acoustics and achieving success with the company, Petite changed his name back to Kotsatos. </p>

In 1970, KLH became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Electro Audio Dynamics (EAD) of Great Neck, New York. EAD moved KLH's headquarters to Canoga Park, Los Angeles, in 1980.</p>
