# js-jump-menu
This is a demo of a javascript function that looks at all H2s inside a given container. If the H2 has a proper ID, and also has a data-menutitle attribute, the function will create a left hand nav made up of jump links to content on the page, printing out the data-menutitle value as the link text. This provides some editorial control to make the menu title differ/shorter than the H2 it jumps to.
A demo of this can be seen at [https://nkraft.net/js-jump-menu](https://nkraft.net/js-jump-menu)
